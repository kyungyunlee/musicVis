####My wish to make a music visualizer for house parties was the start of this project.
####I experimented both 2D and 3D design, but since I was using P5 instance mode, I could not figure out how to combine both 2D and WEBGL mode within one sketch, so I decided to go with 3D only.


I was inspired by many resources online, listing a few here:
